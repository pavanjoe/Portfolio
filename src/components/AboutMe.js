      <p className='description'>
      I'm a Computer Science student at VIT Vellore, graduating in 2025. My deep passion for technology fuels my journey in software development, data science, and emerging technologies. Proficient in Python, Java, and JavaScript, I'm dedicated to staying ahead in this ever-evolving field. Outside of coding, I find joy in the beautiful game of football, where teamwork is paramount. Music is my creative sanctuary, providing balance to my tech-driven world.
